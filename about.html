					<h3> STEM Conference Committee: </h3>
					As part of this committee, I organized the largest student-run STEM conference in Canada. Our goal for this conference was to inspire youth, particularly those who are entering high school, to partake in STEM. The conference hosted many different companies such as Facebook, and organized seminars where speakers highlighted the responsibilties of various jobs in STEM field.
