					<h3> STEM Conference Committee: </h3>
					As part of this committee, I organized the largest student-run STEM conference in Canada. Our goal for this conference was to inspire youth, particularly those who are entering high school, to partake in STEM. The conference hosted many different companies such as Facebook, and organized seminars where speakers highlighted the responsibilties of various jobs in STEM field.

					<h3> Women in Computer Science - Undergraduate Committee: </h3>
					The University of Waterloo's Women in Computer Science comittee (WiCS) actively supports women in the computer science program by hosting daily office hours, planning events, and providing
					a safe space for women. As part of the comittee, I improved my organizational and interpersonal skills by planning and running events, as well as communicating with and supporting my fellow women in the 
					computer science faculty.
